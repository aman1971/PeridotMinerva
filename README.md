# README ‚úçÔ∏è

This is an ongrowing repository that contains different open source licenses in text format. The licenses that are present
here were taken from [Minerva Dataset](https://github.com/fossology/Minerva-Dataset-Generation). 

## Why do we need PeridotMinerva ü§î

[Minerva Dataset](https://github.com/fossology/Minerva-Dataset-Generation) has a very large amount of license
statements that has been created using some automated process (like n-gramming the same text) and that causes many of the licenses become almost
similar. And that is why the highest accuracy that the trained model has been able to give on [Atarashi](https://github.com/fossology/atarashi)
is just **63** percent (refer to [this Pull Request](https://github.com/fossology/atarashi/pull/102)). [PeridotMinerva](https://github.com/aman1971/PeridotMinerva) is going to have a large amount of open source licenses. And the
licenses are going to be created manually or just by using simple python scripts. We are going to avoid any automated processes like
**n-gramming** as much as possible.
